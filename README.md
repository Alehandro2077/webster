Web app, simple graphic-design tool. Educational project we did in team of 4 members, using stack MERN and jwt, graphics library - fabric js, you can create project(canvas) and save it on backend,
and you can download it like image. This project is not finished yet and has some problems and bugs.

To run the app you should install node modules in client and server, add to server file .env with such constants (with your own data) PORT, DB_URL (mongodb), MAIL_HOST (to send activation link), MAIL_PORT, JWT_ACCESS_SECRET, JWT_REFRESH_SECRET, MAIL_USER, MAIL_PASSWORD, API_URL, CLIENT_URL. Then "npm start" for both server and client.
